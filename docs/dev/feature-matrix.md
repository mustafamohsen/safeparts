# Feature matrix

Update this file when a feature is added, removed, exposed on a new surface, or intentionally left out of a surface.

Status keys:

- `Yes`: implemented and exposed.
- `Core`: implemented in core but not exposed here.
- `No`: not implemented.
- `Planned`: expected future work.
- `N/A`: not relevant for this surface.

## Required update checklist

When a feature changes, answer these before closing the task:

- Which surface owns the source of truth?
- Should CLI, TUI, WASM, web, desktop, help docs, and release packaging expose it now, later, or never?
- Which tests prove the core behavior and each exposed boundary?
- Does any `AGENTS.md` contract need a new rule?
- Does a developer guide need a new workflow or warning?
- Does user-facing documentation need an approved update?
- Does the change affect generated artifacts or release assets?

## Common future feature paths

### New share encoding

1. Implement encode/decode in `safeparts_core`.
2. Add parser and detection rules if auto encoding should support it.
3. Add core round-trip and negative tests.
4. Expose through CLI and TUI if the encoding is stable.
5. Add WASM bindings only through the core encoding API.
6. Decide whether web exposes it. If web exposes it, desktop should follow.
7. Update this matrix, surface guides, and relevant user docs.

### New UI workflow

1. Start in the web UI if it is a product feature.
2. Keep desktop UI parity unless there is a documented desktop-only reason.
3. Add browser accessibility coverage for stable flows.
4. Add Tauri command tests when the desktop command boundary changes.
5. Update this matrix and the web/desktop surface guides.

### New release artifact

1. Add the build or packaging path in scripts or release CI.
2. Document local verification in `verification.md` and `surfaces/release.md`.
3. Update checksums and artifact naming rules.
4. Update this matrix.
