# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Title

**Safeparts** - Threshold secret sharing toolkit (Rust core + CLI + TUI + Web UI + Help site)

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

Safeparts is a cross-platform tool and library for splitting arbitrary secrets into
threshold-protected recovery shares (k-of-n). Shares are stored separately and can
be combined to reconstruct the original secret.

The project ships as a single repo with multiple deliverables:

- Rust core library: `crates/safeparts_core/`
- CLI: `crates/safeparts/` (`safeparts`)
- TUI: `crates/safeparts_tui/` (`safeparts-tui`) + a `safeparts tui` launcher
- WASM bindings for the browser: `crates/safeparts_wasm/`
- Web UI (Vite + React): `web/`
- Help website (Astro Starlight, i18n): `web/help/`

Primary use cases:

- Backing up recovery keys, API tokens, secrets manager master keys, or any arbitrary
  bytes.
- Social recovery (distribute shares across trusted parties).
- Separation of duties (require multiple people to reconstruct).
- Geographic separation (reduce "single location" failure).

Non-goals:

- This is not a full secrets manager.
- This is not a wallet/seed product. Mnemonics are an encoding for share packets.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core: Split / Combine

- Input: arbitrary bytes.
- Algorithm: Shamir-style secret sharing over GF(256).
- Parameters: `k` and `n` with `1 <= k <= n <= 255`.
- Output: `n` share packets with:
  - set ID (random)
  - `k`, `n`, share index `x`
  - payload bytes
  - optional crypto parameters
- Integrity: BLAKE3 tag ensures reconstruction fails for corrupted/mismatched shares.
- Optional encryption: encrypt-before-split using Argon2id -> ChaCha20-Poly1305.

### 2.2 Encodings

Safeparts defines a binary share packet format and supports multiple reversible
text encodings.

Implemented encodings in the Rust toolchain:

- `base64` / `base64url`: URL-safe, no padding
- `base58` / `base58check`: Base58 with checksum
- `mnemo-words`: single sentence using the BIP-39 word list as an alphabet + CRC16
- `mnemo-bip39`: valid BIP-39 mnemonics, may be multiple phrases per share

Web UI currently supports:

- `base64url`
- `mnemo-words`

(The CLI/TUI support the full encoding set.)

### 2.3 CLI

The CLI is non-interactive by default and script-friendly.

Commands:

```bash
safeparts split -k 2 -n 3 -e mnemo-words
safeparts combine --encoding base64
safeparts tui
```

Requirements:

- `split` reads from stdin by default, or `--in <file>`.
- `combine` reads shares from stdin by default, or `--in <file>`.
- `--out <file>` writes output to a file; otherwise stdout.
- Passphrase is provided via `--passphrase` or `--passphrase-file`.
- `combine` supports encoding auto-detection when `--encoding` is omitted.

### 2.4 TUI

The TUI provides an interactive workflow for:

- entering a secret
- selecting `k`, `n`, encoding, passphrase
- splitting and copying shares
- pasting shares and reconstructing

Requirements:

- Keyboard-first operation.
- Clipboard support (system clipboard when possible; OSC52 fallback where supported).
- Load/save secrets and shares from/to files.

### 2.5 Web UI

The Web UI is a static site built with Vite + React and uses WASM bindings for all
cryptographic operations.

Requirements:

- No backend required.
- Split and combine happen locally in the browser (WASM).
- Share encoding auto-detection when pasting shares in the combine UI.
- i18n: English + Arabic (RTL) UI.

### 2.6 Help Website

Safeparts includes a documentation site built with Astro Starlight.

Requirements:

- Served under `/help/` on the same domain as the main app.
- i18n: English + Arabic (RTL).
- Includes docs for the Web UI, CLI, TUI, build/run instructions, encodings, and
  security notes.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

Security:

- Threshold secrecy: fewer than `k` shares reveal nothing about the secret.
- Integrity: reconstruction fails when shares are corrupted or mismatched.
- Optional passphrase encryption uses modern KDF + AEAD.
- Zeroize secret material where practical (`zeroize`).
- Minimize sensitive logging. Treat shares and reconstructed secrets as secrets.

Local-first:

- Web UI runs entirely client-side.
- No cookies or analytics are required for core functionality.

Portability:

- Rust components support Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Web and docs build into a single static bundle for easy self-hosting.

---

## 4. Repository & Build Model

Rust:

- CI runs `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`.

Web:

- Package manager: Bun.
- WASM build step is required before the Web UI works.

```bash
cd web
bun install
bun run build:wasm
bun run build
```

Help site:

```bash
cd web
bun run help:build
```

Deployment:

- Netlify builds and publishes `web/dist/`.
- The docs build output is placed in `web/dist/help/`.

---

## 5. Current Status vs Backlog

Implemented:

- Core split/combine + integrity + optional passphrase encryption.
- Base64url, Base58check, mnemo-words, mnemo-bip39 encodings in Rust.
- CLI + TUI.
- WASM bindings.
- Web UI (split/combine) with encoding auto-detection.
- Help website under `/help/` with English/Arabic.

Backlog / future ideas (not required for current release):

- Web UI support for Base58check and mnemo-bip39.
- QR code export.
- Optional import/export compatibility with other tools.
- Improved cross-platform packaging (installers, signed releases).

## Git workflow

- Always commit atomically after each meaningful task 
- Write conventional commits style commit messages
- Prefer rebase over merge
- When starting a new feature, create a feature branch
