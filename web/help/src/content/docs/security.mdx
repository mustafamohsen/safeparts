Safeparts removes single points of failure.
It does not make storage and distribution decisions for you.

## Threat model (what to assume)

- If an attacker gets <var>k</var> shares, they can reconstruct the secret.
- If an attacker gets fewer than <var>k</var> shares, they learn nothing useful.
- If you lose too many shares (fewer than <var>k</var> remain), recovery is impossible.

:::caution
Treat shares like the secret itself.
Don't paste them into chat, tickets, logs, or screenshots.
:::

## Storage rules

<Steps>
1. Separate failure modes: different people, devices, and locations.
2. Avoid co-location: two shares in the same safe is one compromise away from disclosure.
3. Avoid centralization: a shared drive holding multiple shares defeats the point.
4. Keep a contact/runbook: who holds each share, and what to do if someone is unavailable.
5. Practice recovery periodically.
</Steps>

## Passphrases (optional)

Safeparts can encrypt the secret before splitting it.
With a passphrase, an attacker needs both:

- at least <var>k</var> shares, and
- the passphrase.

:::note
Passphrases do not replace share separation.
They add a second requirement, but the storage plan is still the security boundary.
:::

## Web UI privacy boundary

The web UI runs split/combine entirely in your browser via WASM (no backend required).
Your secret is not uploaded unless you choose to copy/paste it somewhere else or deploy a modified build.

## Build output

When deploying the web UI yourself, publish <span class="token token--mono">web/dist/</span>.
