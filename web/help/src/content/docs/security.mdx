description: What Safeparts does (and does not) do to keep secrets safe.
---

Safeparts is designed so your *secret material* can stay on your device while you
generate recovery shares.

## Web app properties

- No cookies.
- No analytics/tracking.
- Secret splitting/combining runs locally (WASM).
- Open source and self-hostable.

:::note
Starlight (this docs site) and the web UI may store non-secret preferences in
`localStorage` (e.g., theme). This is not a cookie.
:::

## What "local" means here

Safeparts does not send your secret to a server for processing.

However, data can still leave your device when you choose to:

- Copy/paste shares into other apps.
- Save shares to synced folders.
- Share your screen / paste into chat.

:::caution
Treat shares like the secret itself. If an attacker obtains `k` shares, they can
reconstruct.
:::

## Integrity and passphrases

- Safeparts includes an integrity tag (BLAKE3) so mismatched/corrupted shares fail.
- If you use a passphrase, Safeparts encrypts before splitting (Argon2id -> ChaCha20-Poly1305).

## Self-hosting

To self-host the full site (app + docs) as one static bundle:

```bash
cd web
bun install
bun run build:wasm
bun run build
bun run help:build
```

Publish `web/dist/`.
