import { LinkButton, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The web UI lives at the site root (<span class="token token--mono">/</span>). It uses WASM bindings so split/combine runs
locally in your browser.

<LinkButton href="/" icon="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	Open the web app

## Split a secret

<Steps>
  1. Enter the secret in the **Secret** box.
  2. Choose <var>k</var> (minimum shares to recover) and <var>n</var> (total shares to create).
  3. Choose a share format.
  4. Optionally set a passphrase (encrypt-before-split).
  5. Click **Split** and copy each share to a separate storage location.
</Steps>

## Combine shares

<Steps>
  1. Set the share format (or paste a share and let the UI auto-detect).
  2. Paste at least <var>k</var> shares.
  3. Enter the passphrase if shares were created with one.
  4. Click **Combine**.
</Steps>

:::caution
Avoid reconstructing secrets on shared machines, and avoid copying recovered secrets
into tools that sync by default.
