## What Safeparts is

Safeparts helps you split a sensitive secret into multiple **recovery shares** so no
single person, device, or location holds the whole thing.

You choose a threshold (**k of n**):

- With fewer than <var>k</var> shares, an attacker learns nothing useful about the secret.
- With any <var>k</var> shares, you can reconstruct the original secret.

Safeparts ships as:

- A **Web UI** (this repo’s <span class="token token--mono">web/</span> app) that runs the split/combine logic locally via WASM.
- A scriptable **CLI** (`safeparts`).
- An interactive **TUI** (`safeparts-tui`).

## How it stays safe

Safeparts shares are more than just “chunks” of data:

- **Threshold secrecy** via Shamir-style secret sharing over GF(256).
- **Integrity check**: a BLAKE3 tag is included so reconstruction fails if shares are wrong/corrupted.
- **Optional passphrase protection**: encrypt-before-split (Argon2id -> ChaCha20-Poly1305).

:::note
Mnemonic formats use the BIP-39 word list for readability and typo detection.
They are **not wallet seeds**.

:::caution
Shares are sensitive artifacts. Treat them like the original secret:

- Don’t store all shares together.
- Don’t paste shares into chat, tickets, or logs.
- Prefer printing / offline storage for long-term recovery plans.

## What it’s good for (and not)

Safeparts is a good fit when you want to reduce single points of failure (one vault,
one person, one laptop) and you can manage operational discipline around storage and
recovery.

It is not a replacement for access control, auditing, or a full secrets manager.
It’s a building block.
