Safeparts splits one sensitive secret into multiple **recovery shares**.
Later, you can recover the original secret using **k of n** shares.

:::caution
Shares are sensitive. Don't paste real shares into chat, tickets, issues, or logs.
When documenting or testing, use synthetic secrets.
:::

## The Problem

Most people back up a secret by making one copy. That creates a single point of failure:

```
Secret -> One backup

If the backup is stolen: secret exposed
If the backup is lost:    secret unrecoverable
```

Safeparts distributes risk across people and places. With k-of-n sharing:

- One share stolen is not enough to expose the secret.
- One share lost is not fatal to recovery.

```
Secret -> n shares

Attacker needs k shares
You need k shares
```

## Understanding k-of-n

- `n` is how many shares you create
- `k` is how many shares are required to recover

With `k=2, n=3`: you create 3 shares, any 2 can recover, you can lose 1 and still recover.

### Choosing k and n

Pick `k` based on who must approve recovery. Pick `n` based on how many losses you can tolerate.

`n = k + number of shares you can afford to lose`

Practical defaults:
- Personal use: `k=2, n=3`
- Teams: `k=3, n=5`

:::tip
A simple plan people can execute under stress beats a perfect plan nobody follows.

## Practice First

Before splitting a real secret, do a 3-minute dry run with a fake secret.

<Steps>
1. Choose an interface (Web UI / CLI / TUI).
2. Split the secret `example-secret` with `k=2, n=3`.
3. Immediately recover it using any 2 shares.
4. If recovery works smoothly, proceed with your real secret.
</Steps>

## Scenario: Password Manager Recovery Key

**Problem**: Your password manager protects hundreds of credentials, but the recovery key is a single point of failure. If you lose it, you're locked out. If someone steals it, they own your digital life.

**Solution**: Split the recovery key so you need cooperation between two locations to recover, but losing one share doesn't lock you out.

**Setup**: `k=2, n=3` using the Web UI

<LinkButton href="/" icon="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	Open the web app
</LinkButton>

<Steps>
1. Paste your recovery key into **Secret**.
2. Set `k=2` and `n=3`.
3. Choose an encoding (see [Encodings](encodings/)).
4. Click **Split**.
5. Store each share in a different place.
6. Test recovery with any 2 shares before deleting the original key.
</Steps>

Storage plan:

```
Share 1: Your safe or deposit box
Share 2: Trusted person (family/friend)
Share 3: Separate encrypted storage service

Recovery requires: you + one other source
Resilience: lose any one share, still recoverable
```

## Scenario: Break-Glass Production Credential

**Problem**: Your production database password must be accessible during emergencies, but giving it to one person creates a security risk. Storing it in one vault creates a single point of failure. You need multiple people to approve access.

**Solution**: Split the credential across roles so no single person can access it alone, but any authorized group can recover it during an incident.

**Setup**: `k=3, n=5` using the CLI

<Steps>
1. Define your policy (who must approve recovery).
2. Split the credential using the CLI.
3. Distribute shares to roles, not individuals.
4. Write a recovery runbook (approval process, rotation policy).
5. Run a tabletop exercise to verify the process.
</Steps>

Split:

```bash
echo -n "example-break-glass-secret" | safeparts split -k 3 --threshold 5
```

Distribution pattern:

```
Share 1: On-call lead (role)
Share 2: Security team (role)
Share 3: Engineering manager (role)
Share 4: Physical safe (offline)
Share 5: Off-site encrypted backup

Recovery requires: 3 of 5 shares (multi-party approval)
Resilience: lose any 2 shares, still recoverable
```

Recover:

```bash
printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n" "<share1>" "<share2>" "<share3>" | safeparts combine
```

:::caution
After any break-glass event, rotate the credential and re-split. Treat shares as potentially compromised once used outside normal storage.

## Scenario: Cryptocurrency Seed Phrase

**Problem**: A seed phrase grants complete control of your funds. If it's stolen, your funds are gone. If it's lost, your funds are permanently inaccessible. Storing it digitally risks malware. Storing it on paper creates a single point of failure.

**Solution**: Split the seed phrase and store shares on physical media in separate locations. Recover on an air-gapped machine to avoid network exposure.

**Setup**: `k=3, n=5` using the TUI on an offline machine

<Steps>
1. Prepare an air-gapped machine (no network, never connected).
2. Run the TUI and set `k=3, n=5`.
3. Record each share on separate physical media (paper, metal, USB).
4. Store media in different geographic locations.
5. Test recovery on the same offline machine before trusting the setup.
</Steps>

Storage plan:

```
Share 1: Home safe
Share 2: Bank deposit box
Share 3: Trusted family member (different city)
Share 4: Attorney or executor
Share 5: Second bank deposit box (different institution)

Recovery requires: 3 of 5 shares (geographic diversity)
Resilience: lose any 2 shares, still recoverable
```

## More Scenarios

Pick the closest pattern and adapt it to your needs.

### Digital Legacy and Estate Planning

**Problem**: When you die or become incapacitated, your digital assets become inaccessible if only you know the credentials. Giving credentials to one person during your lifetime creates security and privacy risks.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=4` — spouse/partner, executor, attorney, and one backup location. Your family can recover without needing you, but no single person can access while you're alive.

### Shared Household Accounts

**Problem**: Couples need shared access to important accounts, but one person losing or exposing the credential locks both out or compromises both.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=3` — each partner holds one share, third share is sealed offline backup. Either partner can initiate recovery, but needs the other's cooperation or the backup.

### Domain Registrar and DNS Recovery

**Problem**: Losing access to your domain registrar can take your entire web presence offline. Storing credentials in one place creates a business continuity risk.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=3` (small business) or `k=3, n=5` (larger teams) — distribute across ops and security roles with one offline share.

### GitHub or GitLab Access Tokens

**Problem**: Personal access tokens grant broad repository access. Storing them in one password manager creates a single point of failure. Losing the token disrupts automation.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=3` — password manager, CI secret store, and offline backup. Compromise or loss of one location doesn't expose or lose the token.

### 2FA Recovery Codes

**Problem**: 2FA recovery codes are often stored in the same password manager as the passwords they protect. If the password manager is compromised, both factors are exposed.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=3` — split the codes so one location being compromised doesn't bypass two-factor protection entirely.

### Shared Service Accounts

**Problem**: Teams need access to shared service accounts (email, cloud admin, payment processors), but turnover and single-person access create continuity and security risks.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=4` — owner, ops, security, and offline backup. Use CLI for repeatable rotation workflows.

### Client Handoff (Agencies)

**Problem**: Agencies hold client credentials during projects. At handoff, you need to transfer access securely without exposing credentials via email or chat.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=3` — agency vault, client vault, and optional escrow. Use Web UI during handoff meetings for visual confirmation.

### Cofounder Continuity

**Problem**: Startups depend on critical credentials held by cofounders. If one founder leaves or becomes unavailable, continuity is at risk. Giving one founder sole access creates single-person dependency.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=4` — two founders, legal counsel, and offline backup. Any two parties can recover, but no single founder controls critical infrastructure alone.

### Separation of Duties (Compliance)

**Problem**: Regulations often require that no single person can perform sensitive operations alone. Storing credentials in one system doesn't satisfy separation-of-duty requirements.

**Solution**: `k=2, n=4` or `k=3, n=5` — distribute shares across roles (engineering, security, compliance, executive). Use CLI for auditable, repeatable processes.
