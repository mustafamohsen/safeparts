Safeparts turns one sensitive secret into multiple **recovery shares**. You can recover the
original secret later with **k of n** shares.

:::caution
Shares are sensitive. Don’t paste real shares into chat, tickets, issues, or logs.
When documenting or testing, use synthetic secrets.
:::

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most people back up a secret by making one copy. That creates a single point of failure:

```
Secret -> One backup

If the backup is stolen: secret exposed
If the backup is lost:    secret unrecoverable
```

With Safeparts, you can distribute risk across people and places:

```
Secret -> n shares

Attacker needs k shares
You need k shares
```

## Pick The Right Interface

		[Read the Web UI guide](web-ui/)
	</Card>
	<Card title="CLI" icon="terminal">
		Best for automation, scripts, and repeatable operational playbooks.

	<Card title="TUI" icon="keyboard">
		Best for interactive terminal workflows (including remote/SSH environments).

## The k-of-n Mental Model

- `n` = how many shares you create
- `k` = how many shares are required to recover

Example: `k=2, n=3`

```
You create 3 shares.
Any 2 shares can recover.
You can lose 1 share and still recover.
```

### Choosing k and n (practical rule)

Pick `k` based on **who must approve recovery**, then pick `n` based on **how many losses you can tolerate**.

Rule of thumb:

`n = k + (number of shares you can afford to lose)`

## Examples By Situation

Each example includes:

- Suggested `k` and `n`
- A distribution pattern (who/where)
- A recommended interface (Web UI / CLI / TUI)

### 1) Password manager recovery key (personal)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: one share with a trusted person, one in a safe/deposit box, one in a separate vault/vendor
- Interface: Web UI

### 2) Seed phrase backup (individual)

- Suggested: `k=3, n=5` for high value; `k=2, n=3` for simpler setups
- Store: separate physical locations; consider one offline paper/metal share
- Interface: TUI (offline machine) or Web UI

### 3) Digital legacy / estate planning (family)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4`
- Store: spouse/partner + executor/attorney + secure physical location + optional extra trusted person
- Interface: Web UI

### 4) Shared household account (family)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: two adults each hold one share; third share is a sealed offline backup
- Interface: Web UI

### 5) 2FA recovery codes (personal)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: split codes so one compromised password manager does not expose everything
- Interface: Web UI

### 6) Domain registrar / DNS admin recovery (small business)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`
- Store: separate roles (ops + security) and one offline share
- Interface: CLI (repeatable process) or Web UI (one-off)

### 7) GitHub/GitLab personal access token (developer)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: password manager + CI secret store + offline backup
- Interface: CLI

### 8) Break-glass production credential (team)

- Suggested: `k=3, n=5`
- Store: different people/roles; document a recovery playbook; rotate after use
- Interface: CLI

### 9) Shared service accounts (small team)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4`
- Store: owner + ops + security + offline backup
- Interface: CLI for rotation, Web UI for setup

### 10) Client handoff (agency)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: agency vault + client vault + optional escrow
- Interface: Web UI for handoff meeting

### 11) Cofounder continuity (startup)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4`
- Store: two founders + legal counsel + offline backup
- Interface: CLI for operational repeatability

### 12) Compliance: separation of duties (enterprise)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4` or `k=3, n=5`
- Store: distribute across roles so no single person can recover alone
- Interface: CLI
