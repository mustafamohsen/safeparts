description: Pick a recovery plan and run a safe first split.

Safeparts helps you split a single secret into recovery shares, so recovery requires cooperation instead of one perfect backup.

:::caution
Shares are sensitive. Don’t paste real shares into chat, tickets, issues, or logs.
When you need examples, use synthetic secrets.
:::

## Mental model

Safeparts turns one secret into <var>n</var> shares. Recovery requires any <var>k</var> shares.

- Fewer than <var>k</var> shares: an attacker learns nothing useful.
- Any <var>k</var> shares: you can reconstruct the original secret.

## Choose <var>k</var> and <var>n</var>

Think of <var>k</var> as “how many people/places must agree” and <var>n</var> as “how many losses you can survive”.

<var>n</var> = <var>k</var> + losses you can tolerate

Defaults that work well in practice:

- Personal recovery: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>
- Teams: <span class="token">k=3, n=5</span>

:::tip
Pick a plan people can execute under stress.
If the plan is too clever, it will fail at the moment it matters.

## Do a practice run (recommended)

Do this once with a fake secret so you learn the workflow before using a real key.

<Steps>
1. Pick <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
2. Split a synthetic secret such as <span class="token">example-secret</span>.
3. Store the 3 shares in 3 different places (even temporarily).
4. Recover using any 2 shares.
5. Delete the synthetic shares.
</Steps>

## Storage rules

<Steps>
1. Don’t co-locate shares. Two shares in the same vault is one incident away from disclosure.
2. Don’t centralize “for convenience”. A shared drive holding multiple shares defeats the point.
3. Write down who holds which share and how to contact them.
4. Practice recovery once per year (or whenever roles/locations change).
</Steps>

## Example plans

### Personal recovery

Use <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.

Example distribution:

- Share A: password manager note (separate account/device)
- Share B: printed and sealed
- Share C: a trusted person or an off-site safe

### Team infra secret

Use <span class="token">k=3, n=5</span>.

Example distribution:

- Share 1: ops lead
- Share 2: security lead
- Share 3: engineering manager
- Share 4: offline vault
- Share 5: exec/backup location
