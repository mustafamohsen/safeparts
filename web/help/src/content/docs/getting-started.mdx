Safeparts splits one sensitive secret into multiple **recovery shares**.
Later, you can recover the original secret using **k of n** shares.

:::caution
Shares are sensitive. Don't paste real shares into chat, tickets, issues, or logs.
When documenting or testing, use synthetic secrets.

## Why This Is Worth Doing

Most people back up a secret by making one copy. That creates a single point of failure:

```
Secret -> One backup

If the backup is stolen: secret exposed
If the backup is lost:    secret unrecoverable
```

Safeparts helps you avoid both outcomes:

- Reduce compromise risk: one share stolen is not enough.
- Reduce lockout risk: one share lost is not fatal.

With k-of-n sharing, you distribute risk across people and places:

```
Secret -> n shares

Attacker needs k shares
You need k shares
```

## Pick The Right Tool

The best interface depends on how technical you want the workflow to be and whether you need repeatability.

## k-of-n In Plain Terms

- `n` = how many shares you create
- `k` = how many shares are required to recover

Example: `k=2, n=3`

```
You create 3 shares.
Any 2 shares can recover.
You can lose 1 share and still recover.
```

### Choosing k and n (practical rule)

Pick `k` based on **who must approve recovery**, then pick `n` based on **how many losses you can tolerate**.

Rule of thumb:

`n = k + (number of shares you can afford to lose)`

Common defaults:

- Individuals / families: `k=2, n=3`
- Teams / organizations: `k=3, n=5`

:::tip
Make it usable first. A plan people can execute under stress beats a perfect plan nobody follows.

## Tutorial: Do One Dry Run First

Before you split a real secret, do a 3-minute rehearsal using a fake secret.

<Steps>
1. Choose an interface (Web UI / CLI / TUI).
2. Split the secret `example-secret` with `k=2, n=3`.
3. Immediately recover it using any 2 shares.
4. If you can do this smoothly, proceed with your real secret.
</Steps>

## Walkthrough A (Personal): Password manager recovery key (Web UI)

Use this when you want a simple workflow and you are not scripting anything.

<LinkButton href="/" icon="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	Open the web app
</LinkButton>

<Steps>
1. Paste your recovery key into **Secret**.
2. Choose `k=2` and `n=3`.
3. Choose an encoding (see [Encodings](encodings/)).
4. Click **Split**.
5. Store each share in a different place (example plan below).
6. Do a dry run: recover using any 2 shares and confirm you get the original key.
</Steps>

Example storage plan (`k=2, n=3`):

```
Share 1: Your safe / deposit box
Share 2: Trusted person
Share 3: Separate account/vendor

Recovery requires: you + any one other source
```

## Walkthrough B (Team/Enterprise): Break-glass credential (CLI)

Use this when you need approvals, repeatability, and a written operational playbook.

<Steps>
1. Decide a policy: start with `k=3, n=5`.
2. Split the secret using the CLI.
3. Distribute shares to roles (not just people).
4. Write a recovery runbook (who approves, where recovery happens, how to rotate).
5. Run a tabletop exercise: practice recovery once.
</Steps>

Split (placeholder secret):

```bash
echo -n "example-break-glass-secret" | safeparts split -k 3 -n 5
```

Distribution pattern (`k=3, n=5`):

```
Share 1: On-call lead (role)
Share 2: Security (role)
Share 3: Engineering manager (role)
Share 4: Offline safe (physical)
Share 5: Off-site encrypted backup
```

Recover (with placeholders):

```bash
printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n" "<share1>" "<share2>" "<share3>" | safeparts combine
```

:::caution
After any real break-glass event, rotate the secret and re-split. Treat shares as compromised once they leave normal storage.
:::

## Walkthrough C (High-safety): Offline / air-gapped recovery (TUI)

Use this when you want recovery to happen on a machine that never touches the internet.

<Steps>
1. Prepare an offline machine (no network).
2. Run the TUI and choose a setup like `k=3, n=5`.
3. Record each share on separate media (paper, USB, metal).
4. Store media in different locations.
5. Test recovery on the same offline machine.
</Steps>

## Use Case Catalog

If you don't need a full walkthrough, pick the closest pattern and adapt it.

1. Password manager recovery key: `k=2,n=3` (Web UI)
2. Seed phrase backup: `k=3,n=5` (TUI offline)
3. Digital legacy / estate plan: `k=2,n=4` (Web UI)
4. Shared household account: `k=2,n=3` (Web UI)
5. 2FA recovery codes: `k=2,n=3` (Web UI)
6. Domain/DNS recovery codes: `k=2,n=3` (CLI)
7. GitHub/GitLab access token: `k=2,n=3` (CLI)
8. Break-glass production credential: `k=3,n=5` (CLI)
9. Shared service accounts: `k=2,n=4` (CLI)
10. Client handoff: `k=2,n=3` (Web UI)
11. Cofounder continuity: `k=2,n=4` (CLI)
12. Separation of duties: `k=3,n=5` (CLI)

## Examples By Situation

Each example includes:

- Suggested `k` and `n`
- A distribution pattern (who/where)
- A recommended interface (Web UI / CLI / TUI)

### 1) Password manager recovery key (personal)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: one share with a trusted person, one in a safe/deposit box, one in a separate vault/vendor
- Interface: Web UI

### 2) Seed phrase backup (individual)

- Suggested: `k=3, n=5` for high value; `k=2, n=3` for simpler setups
- Store: separate physical locations; consider one offline paper/metal share
- Interface: TUI (offline machine) or Web UI

### 3) Digital legacy / estate planning (family)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4`
- Store: spouse/partner + executor/attorney + secure physical location + optional extra trusted person
- Interface: Web UI

### 4) Shared household account (family)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: two adults each hold one share; third share is a sealed offline backup
- Interface: Web UI

### 5) 2FA recovery codes (personal)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: split codes so one compromised password manager does not expose everything
- Interface: Web UI

### 6) Domain registrar / DNS admin recovery (small business)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`
- Store: separate roles (ops + security) and one offline share
- Interface: CLI (repeatable process) or Web UI (one-off)

### 7) GitHub/GitLab personal access token (developer)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: password manager + CI secret store + offline backup
- Interface: CLI

### 8) Break-glass production credential (team)

- Suggested: `k=3, n=5`
- Store: different people/roles; document a recovery playbook; rotate after use
- Interface: CLI

### 9) Shared service accounts (small team)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4`
- Store: owner + ops + security + offline backup
- Interface: CLI for rotation, Web UI for setup

### 10) Client handoff (agency)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=3`
- Store: agency vault + client vault + optional escrow
- Interface: Web UI for handoff meeting

### 11) Cofounder continuity (startup)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4`
- Store: two founders + legal counsel + offline backup
- Interface: CLI for operational repeatability

### 12) Compliance: separation of duties (enterprise)

- Suggested: `k=2, n=4` or `k=3, n=5`
- Store: distribute across roles so no single person can recover alone
- Interface: CLI
