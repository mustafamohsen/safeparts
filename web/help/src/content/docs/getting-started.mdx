description: Pick a recovery plan and run a safe first split.

import { Card, CardGrid, LinkButton, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Safeparts splits one secret into recovery shares so recovery requires cooperation, not one perfect backup.

:::caution
Shares are sensitive. Don't paste real shares into chat, tickets, issues, or logs.
When you need examples, use synthetic secrets.
:::

## Mental model

Safeparts turns one secret into <var>n</var> shares. Recovery requires any <var>k</var> shares.

- Fewer than <var>k</var> shares: an attacker learns nothing useful.
- Any <var>k</var> shares: you can reconstruct the original secret.

Practical limits: <span class="token" dir="ltr">1 &lt;= k &lt;= n &lt;= 255</span>.

## Pick a recovery plan

The hard part is logistics: who holds which share, how you contact them, and what you do when someone is unavailable.

Start with [Use cases](use-cases/) to choose <var>k</var>/<var>n</var> and a distribution you can actually run.

## Pick an interface

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Web UI" icon="laptop">
		Good for one-off workflows and visual confirmation.
		
		[Web UI guide](web-ui/)
	</Card>
	<Card title="CLI" icon="document">
		Good for automation and repeatable runbooks.
		
		[CLI guide](cli/)
	</Card>
	<Card title="TUI" icon="setting">
		Good for offline machines and interactive terminal workflows.
		
		[TUI guide](tui/)
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Do a practice run (recommended)

Do this once with a fake secret so you learn the flow before you trust it with a real key.

<Steps>
1. Pick <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
2. Split a synthetic secret such as <span class="token">example-secret</span>.
3. Store the 3 shares in 3 different places (even temporarily).
4. Recover using any 2 shares.
5. Delete the synthetic shares.
</Steps>

## Before you split a real key

Read [Security](security/) and follow the storage rules there.
Safeparts can remove single points of failure, but it can't fix a bad distribution.
