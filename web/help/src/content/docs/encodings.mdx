title: Encodings
description: How shares are represented (machine-friendly and human-friendly).
---

Safeparts produces and consumes **share packets**. Encodings are just different ways
to represent the same packet bytes.

## Machine-friendly

### `base64` (base64url)

- URL-safe (`-` and `_`)
- No padding
- Good for copy/paste and scripts

### `base58`

- Avoids ambiguous characters
- Often nicer for manual transcription than base64

## Human-friendly

### `mnemo-words`

- A single sentence of lowercase words
- Uses the BIP-39 English word list as a 2048-symbol alphabet
- Includes CRC16 to detect many typos

### `mnemo-bip39`

- Uses full BIP-39-valid sentences (with the standard checksum)
- A single share may become multiple sentences, depending on payload size

:::caution
Mnemonic shares are **not wallet seeds** and should not be imported into wallet apps.
They are an encoding for Safeparts share packets.
