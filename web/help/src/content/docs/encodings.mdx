description: Choose a share format that matches your workflow.
---

Encodings change how shares are represented for storage and transfer.
The underlying share packet is the same.

:::note
Pick the format you can reliably store and recover.
The best format is the one your recovery plan can execute.

## Machine-friendly

### <span class="token">base64</span> (base64url)

- Compact and easy to copy/paste
- URL-safe (<span class="token token--mono">-</span> and <span class="token token--mono">_</span>)
- Best when shares live in password managers or secure secret stores

### <span class="token">base58</span> (base58check)

- Avoids ambiguous characters
- Has an integrated checksum (Base58Check)
- Good for manual copy/paste when you want fewer visually confusing characters

## Human-friendly

### <span class="token">mnemo-words</span>

- Words are easier to transcribe than long strings
- Includes CRC16 to catch typos
- Good for paper/metal backups

### <span class="token">mnemo-bip39</span>

- Uses BIP-39-valid word sequences
- Fits environments that already handle BIP-39 wordlists

:::caution
Mnemonic shares are not wallet seeds.
Do not import them into wallet software.
