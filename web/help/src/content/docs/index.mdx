## Start here

Safeparts is a k-of-n recovery tool.
It lets you spread one secret across people and places so recovery takes cooperation, not one perfect backup.

		Do one short practice run, learn how to pick <var>k</var> and <var>n</var>, and write down a recovery plan you can follow on a bad day.

:::caution
Shares are sensitive. Don't paste real shares into chat, tickets, or logs.
When you need examples for docs or debugging, use synthetic secrets.
:::

:::note
If you're choosing a plan for the first time, start simple and do a practice run.
You can always re-split later.
