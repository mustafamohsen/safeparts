## Web UI says <samp>WASM module not found</samp>

Build the WASM package and reload:

```bash
cd web
bun run build:wasm
bun run dev
```

On Windows, see the Windows notes in [Build & run](../build-and-run/).

## CLI combine can't detect the encoding

If auto-detect fails, specify it explicitly:

```bash
safeparts combine --encoding mnemo-words
```

## Reconstruction fails integrity checks

This usually means one of:

- At least one share is mistyped/corrupted.
- Shares are from different sets (metadata mismatch).
- Wrong passphrase (if encryption was used).

## Clipboard doesn't work in the TUI

Some environments restrict clipboard access. Safeparts-tui will fall back to OSC52
copy sequences when it can; if that still doesn't work, use the save-to-file shortcut
and copy from your terminal/editor.
