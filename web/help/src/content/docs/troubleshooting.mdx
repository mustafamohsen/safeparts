## Combine fails

Most combine failures are one of these:

- not enough shares (<var>k</var>)
- shares from different sets
- a corrupted share / a typo
- the wrong passphrase

<Steps>
1. Confirm you have at least <var>k</var> shares.
2. Confirm all shares were created together (same split run).
3. If you used a passphrase, verify the exact passphrase file/value.
4. If you're still stuck, re-split a synthetic secret and validate the workflow end-to-end.
</Steps>

## Web UI says <samp>WASM module not found</samp>

This usually means the WASM build step was not run.

<Steps>
1. From <span class="token token--mono">web/</span>, run <span class="token token--mono">bun run build:wasm</span>.
2. Restart the dev server (<span class="token token--mono">bun run dev</span>).
</Steps>

## Still stuck?

:::caution
Use synthetic examples when asking for help. Never post real secrets or real shares.
