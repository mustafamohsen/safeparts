title: Use cases
description: Real-world scenarios and how to choose a share distribution.

import { Card, CardGrid, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Use cases are not just “what <var>k</var>/<var>n</var> to pick”. They’re about who can realistically collaborate when recovery is needed.

:::tip
If you need a starting point: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span> for personal recovery, <span class="token">k=3, n=5</span> for teams.
:::

:::caution
Safeparts does not prevent reconstruction by someone who holds <var>k</var> shares.
Security comes from where shares live and who can access them.
:::

## Scenarios

Use this page to pick a plan you can actually execute: who holds which share, what happens if someone is unavailable, and how you practice recovery.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Password manager recovery" icon="star">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
		Two locations you control, one off-site fallback.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Family / executor planning" icon="open-book">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=4</span>.
		Recovery without any single person holding full access.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Small team infra secret" icon="document">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=3, n=5</span>.
		Distribute across roles plus one offline vault.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Break-glass procedure" icon="setting">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=4</span>.
		Keep one share offline; require two parties to recover during incidents.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Two-factor backup codes" icon="laptop">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
		Store shares so a single device compromise doesn’t disable 2FA.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Agency / client handoff" icon="pen">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
		Split between agency vault, client vault, and a sealed offline copy.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Pattern: personal recovery (<span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>)

Good for password manager recovery keys, 2FA backup codes, and other personal secrets.

Suggested distribution:

- Share A: a place you can reach quickly (password manager note, separate device/account)
- Share B: sealed offline copy (paper/metal)
- Share C: off-site fallback (trusted person, safe deposit box)

<Steps>
1. Split with <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
2. Place the shares in the three locations.
3. Perform a recovery drill using any 2 shares.
4. Write down where the third share lives and how to access it.
</Steps>

## Pattern: team secret (<span class="token">k=3, n=5</span>)

Good when you want separation of duties: no one person can act alone, but the team can still recover during an incident.

Suggested distribution (by role):

- Share 1: operations
- Share 2: security
- Share 3: engineering lead
- Share 4: executive sponsor
- Share 5: offline vault

<Steps>
1. Document who holds each share (role + backup contact).
2. Define an incident runbook: who initiates, how approval happens, where shares are gathered.
3. Practice once before using the plan for production secrets.
</Steps>

## Pattern: break-glass (<span class="token">k=2, n=4</span>)

Good when recovery should be rare and auditable.

Suggested distribution:

- Share 1: on-call lead (rotates)
- Share 2: security lead
- Share 3: offline vault
- Share 4: backup executive or compliance

:::caution
After any break-glass event, rotate the underlying secret and re-split.
Treat gathered shares as compromised.

## How to choose holders

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Prefer independent failures" icon="setting">
		Different people, devices, and locations. Avoid “same safe, two envelopes”.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Design for the worst day" icon="warning">
		Recovery happens when you’re stressed: outages, travel, illness, or loss.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Write down the runbook" icon="document">
		Document who has each share and what to do if a holder is unavailable.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## When to add a passphrase

If the risk of share theft is high (travel, shared environments, hostile endpoints), add a passphrase.
It changes the attacker’s job from “steal <var>k</var> shares” to “steal <var>k</var> shares and the passphrase”.
