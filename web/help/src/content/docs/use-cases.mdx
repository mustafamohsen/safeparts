import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Safeparts is most useful when you want **recovery to require collaboration** or
**geographic separation**.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Personal social recovery" icon="users">
		Split your password manager recovery key across trusted people so any single
		compromise doesn't expose it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Break-glass access" icon="key">
		Store an emergency infra credential so ops + security must cooperate to use it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Physical separation" icon="map">
		Put shares in different locations (home, office, safe deposit box) to reduce
		loss risk.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multi-device backup" icon="laptop">
		Keep shares on different devices/vendors to avoid one account taking you down.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Process-driven recovery" icon="list">
		Build an incident procedure: who holds which shares, and how reconstruction is
		authorized.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Secure handoffs" icon="swap">
		Hand partial access to collaborators without giving any single party the full
		secret.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Practical guidance

:::tip
For most teams, start with `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`. Keep the policy simple enough
that recovery is realistically achievable.
:::

:::caution
Safeparts doesn't prevent someone with `k` shares from reconstructing. Your security
comes from *where shares live* and *who can access them*.
