Safeparts is most useful when you want **recovery to require collaboration** (social
control) or **separation** (so one place/device compromise doesn't end the story).

### Social recovery

Split a password manager recovery key across trusted people.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Why: one compromise can't unlock it; any two can help you recover.

### Physical separation

Store shares in different locations (home, office, safe deposit box).

- Good default: `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`
- Why: fire/theft at one location doesn't destroy recovery.

### Multi-device backup

Keep shares on different devices/vendors (e.g., one offline, one hardware-encrypted,
one paper).

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Why: losing a single device/account doesn't lock you out.

### Break-glass access

Store an emergency infrastructure credential so ops + security must cooperate.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`
- Why: turns risky "superuser" secrets into an auditable, human process.

### Process-driven recovery

Define who holds which shares, where they live, and how reconstruction is approved.

- Good default: `k=3, n=5`
- Why: reduces single points of failure while keeping recovery realistic.

### Secure handoffs

Give collaborators partial custody without any single party holding the whole secret.

- Good default: depends on trust model
- Why: enables shared responsibility without over-sharing.

## Practical guidance

:::tip
For most teams, start with `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`. Keep the policy simple enough
that recovery is realistically achievable.
:::

:::caution
Safeparts doesn't prevent someone with `k` shares from reconstructing. Your security
comes from *where shares live* and *who can access them*.
