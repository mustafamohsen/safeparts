Safeparts is most useful when you want **recovery to require collaboration** (social
control) or **separation** (so one place/device compromise doesn't end the story).

This section is about practical patterns. The goal is to end up with a recovery plan
that is both **secure** and **actually usable** under stress.

### Social recovery

Split a password manager recovery key across trusted people.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Why: one compromise can't unlock it; any two can help you recover.
- Tip: write down *who holds what* and run a dry-run once.

### Physical separation

Store shares in different locations (home, office, safe deposit box).

- Good default: `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`
- Why: fire/theft at one location doesn't destroy recovery.

### Travel / device-loss recovery

If you travel a lot or regularly wipe devices, keep shares so a lost phone/laptop
doesn't become a lockout.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Tip: keep one share offline (paper) and one in a different account/vendor.

### Multi-device backup

Keep shares on different devices/vendors (e.g., one offline, one hardware-encrypted,
one paper).

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Why: losing a single device/account doesn't lock you out.

### Paper escrow (personal)

Print a share and store it as "break glass" recovery.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Tip: label shares by set, but never include the secret itself.

### Break-glass access

Store an emergency infrastructure credential so ops + security must cooperate.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`
- Why: turns risky "superuser" secrets into an auditable, human process.

### Vendor admin / recovery codes

Split root recovery codes (cloud, registrar, email) so one admin account compromise
doesn't give full control.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Tip: store shares out-of-band (not all in the same password manager).

### Process-driven recovery

Define who holds which shares, where they live, and how reconstruction is approved.

- Good default: `k=3, n=5`
- Why: reduces single points of failure while keeping recovery realistic.

### Separation of duties

Use shares to enforce that "deploy" and "approve" are different roles.

- Good default: `k=2, n=3`
- Tip: pair this with human logging (ticket + incident note).

### Secure handoffs

Give collaborators partial custody without any single party holding the whole secret.

- Good default: depends on trust model
- Why: enables shared responsibility without over-sharing.

### Time-boxed access (operational)

If you need temporary access, reconstruct only when needed and immediately rotate
the secret afterward.

- Tip: plan rotation ahead of time (new secret -> new shares).

## Practical guidance

:::tip
For most teams, start with `k=2, n=3` or `k=3, n=5`. Keep the policy simple enough
that recovery is realistically achievable.
:::

:::caution
Safeparts doesn't prevent someone with `k` shares from reconstructing. Your security
comes from *where shares live* and *who can access them*.
