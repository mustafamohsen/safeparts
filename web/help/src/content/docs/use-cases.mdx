description: Real-world scenarios and how to choose a share distribution.

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Use cases are not just “what <var>k</var>/<var>n</var> to pick”. They’re about who can realistically collaborate when recovery is needed.

:::tip
If you need a starting point: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span> for personal recovery, <span class="token">k=3, n=5</span> for teams.
:::

:::caution
Safeparts does not prevent reconstruction by someone who holds <var>k</var> shares.
Security comes from where shares live and who can access them.

## Scenarios

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Password manager recovery" icon="star">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
		Store shares across two locations you control plus one off-site fallback.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Family / executor planning" icon="open-book">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=4</span>.
		Two people can recover without any single person holding full access.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Small team infra secret" icon="document">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=3, n=5</span>.
		Distribute across roles (ops, security, eng, executive) plus one offline vault.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Break-glass procedure" icon="setting">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=4</span>.
		Keep one share offline; require two parties to recover during incidents.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Two-factor backup codes" icon="laptop">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
		Store shares so a single device compromise doesn’t disable 2FA.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Agency / client handoff" icon="pen">
		Recommended: <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span>.
		Split between agency vault, client vault, and a sealed offline copy.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## How to choose holders

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Prefer independent failures" icon="setting">
		Different people, devices, and locations. Avoid “same safe, two envelopes”.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Design for the worst day" icon="warning">
		Recovery happens when you’re stressed: outages, travel, illness, or loss.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Write down the runbook" icon="document">
		Document who has each share and what to do if a holder is unavailable.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
