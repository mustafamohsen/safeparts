:::tip
If you only need a quick starting point: try <span class="token">k=2, n=3</span> for personal recovery and <span class="token">k=3, n=5</span>
for teams with stronger separation of duties.

:::caution
Safeparts doesn’t prevent someone with <var>k</var> shares from reconstructing. Security comes from
where shares live and who can access them.
